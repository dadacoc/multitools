## About the project 📝

This project was born from the desire to create a personal "super-app" that centralizes all the daily tools I need. Above all, it serves as an evolving portfolio to not only master robust software architectures with Flutter, but also to hone my skills in core programming logic, UI/UX design, and creating maintainable, cross-platform applications.

## ✨ Features

* **Home Page :** Displays current time & date, and allows users to manage their favorite app shortcuts for quick access.

* **Catalogue :**  A browsable and searchable list of all available mini-apps.

* **Track chores :** Calculates earnings from completed household chores.

* **Transaction :** Helps to keep an eye on the money we borrow and the money we lend 

* **To Do list :**  A simple yet effective task manager to track objectives.
